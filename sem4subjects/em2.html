                    <h3>Overview of Load Test on Three-Phase Squirrel Cage Induction Motor</h3>
                    <p>The load test on a three-phase squirrel cage induction motor involves applying different load conditions and measuring various parameters, such as torque, output power, efficiency, input power factor, and slip. The results can then be used to plot performance curves, including efficiency vs. output power, torque vs. output power, and more.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Torque:</strong> Torque is calculated from the measured values of input power and speed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Efficiency is determined by dividing output power by the input power, accounting for losses.</li>
                        <li><strong>Slip:</strong> Slip is calculated using the formula: Slip = (Ns - Nr) / Ns, where Ns is the synchronous speed, and Nr is the rotor speed.</li>

                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Torque is calculated using the formula: Torque = (Power Ã— 60) / (2Ï€ Ã— speed).</p>
            
                    <h4>2. How do you determine the efficiency of the motor?</h4>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Efficiency is calculated by dividing the output power by the input power: Efficiency = (Output Power / Input Power) Ã— 100.</p>
            
                    <h4>3. What is the slip of an induction motor?</h4>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Slip is the difference between the synchronous speed and the actual rotor speed, expressed as a percentage of the synchronous speed.</p>

                        <li><strong>Field Current:</strong> The field current controls the magnetic flux and, consequently, the power factor of the synchronous motor.</li>
                        <li><strong>V and Inverted V Curves:</strong> These curves show the relationship between field current, stator current, and power factor.</li>

                    <h3>Viva Questions</h3>
                    <h4>1. How does varying the field current affect the power factor of a synchronous motor?</h4>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Varying the field current changes the motor's excitation, which directly affects the power factor. More excitation (higher field current) improves the power factor, while less excitation (lower field current) degrades the power factor.</p>
            
                    <h4>2. What are V and inverted V curves?</h4>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> V curves show the relationship between field current and stator current, while inverted V curves represent the relationship between field current and power factor.</p>
